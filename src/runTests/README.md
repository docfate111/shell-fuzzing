# what each script does
I couldn't name the scripts correctly or their names should be too long
checkInstall.js - checks if the shells are installed and in PATH
runTests.js - runs tests on the programs the Python program generates
test.js - a path to a shell script should be the argument and it runs all the programs
on every shell installed and in PATH
